I am a research scientist in the [QINFO group](https://team.inria.fr/qinfo/) at [Inria Grenoble](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre-inria-grenoble-rhone-alpes) working in quantum information theory, and a member of the [QuantAlps](https://quantalps.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) Research Federation. I was previously a postdoctoral fellow at the [University of Geneva](https://www.unige.ch/gap/qic/theory/) and the [Institut Néel](https://neel.cnrs.fr/), and I have a joint PhD from the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/) and the [École Normale Supérieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/).

My research is at the intersection of computer science and physics: I am interested in quantum information theory, causal and noncausal structures in quantum information, quantum correlations and quantum communication.
