My background is both in Computer Science and Physics, and my research is particularly focused at the intersection of these fields: what are the implications of quantum resources (entanglement, measurement incompatibility, causal indefiniteness) for information processing. I am also interested in the foundations of quantum mechanics and related philosophical questions.

Some topics I have been working on recently are: quantum information processing with indefinite causal orders, semi-device-independent approaches to quantum information (certification, cryptography, ...), quantum correlations (contextuality and nonlocality). I am particularly interested in looking att how these approaches can be used to improve quantum information processing in the presence of noise.
